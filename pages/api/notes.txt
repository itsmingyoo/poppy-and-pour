This FOLDER NAME is strictly recognized by NextJs
We do not export react components in API routes, only api routes that function as they should
We create function 'handlers' that take in a req, res for params -- taking in a request and sending a response
i.e. Take a look at ./api/feedback.js
    function handler(req, res) {
        handles server side code
        any code here is never exposed to visitors
    }
    export default handler
