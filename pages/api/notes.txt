This folder is strictly recognized by NextJs and will be treated in a special way
We do not export react components in API routes, these are just feedback responses being sent back based on a request
We create function 'handlers' that take in a req, res
i.e. Take a look at ./api/feedback.js
    function handler(req, res) {
        handles server side code
        any code here is never exposed to visitors
    }
    export default handler
